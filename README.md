# Introduction
Non-negative Multiple Tensor Factorization (NMTF) is a method that factorizes the target tensor and the auxiliary tensor simultaneously. The auxiliary tensor compensates for the sparse parts of the target tensor. NMTF is a useful method for extracting feature factors of multivariate data.
