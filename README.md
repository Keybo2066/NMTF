# NMTF
Non-negative Multiple Tensor Factorization.
This is a record for my own study.  
This python script is an attempt to implement [this thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6729621).

## Introduction
Non-negative Multiple Tensor Factorization (NMTF) is a method that factorizes the target tensor and the auxiliary tensor simultaneously. The auxiliary tensor compensates for the sparse parts of the target tensor. NMTF is a useful method for extracting feature factors of multivariate data.
